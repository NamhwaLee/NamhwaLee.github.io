Hello, I'm Namhwa Lee, a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of [Dr. Shujie Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/shujiema).

My primary research interest lies in causal inference, with a focus on applying these methodologies to real-world challenges in healthcare, policy, and education. I am particularly interested in developing robust statistical methods for causal inference, especially in the context of addressing unmeasured confounders in observational data. Additionally, I am keen to explore social disparities using causal mediation analysis and dynamic treatment regimes. I am also eager to expand my research by incorporating more flexible statistical modeling approaches, including mixture modeling, machine learning and nonparametric or semiparametric statistical techniques.

Fun Fact About Myself
======

I was the president of the SKKU Go (Baduk) club. When AlphaGo, developed by Google DeepMind, played against Lee Sedol, one of the world’s top Go players at the time, I recruited new club members by streaming the historic match. As a Baduk trainee, I was confident that Lee Sedol would dominate the game, testing DeepMind's AI against human expertise. However, as we all know, AlphaGo decisively defeated Lee Sedol, and this moment profoundly changed my perspective. Witnessing the power of computational machine learning firsthand sparked my curiosity and ultimately led me to pursue higher education in Statistics. Although I’ve forgotten most of my Baduk strategies over time, I still hope to revisit the game and perhaps connect my understanding of Baduk to my knowledge of AI and machine learning—beyond my academic work.
