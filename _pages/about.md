Hello, I'm Namhwa Lee, a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of [Dr. Shujie Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/shujiema).

My primary research interest lies in causal inference, with a focus on applying these methodologies to real-world challenges in healthcare, policy, and education. I am particularly interested in developing robust statistical methods for causal inference, especially in the context of addressing unmeasured confounders in observational data. Additionally, I am keen to explore social disparities using causal mediation analysis and dynamic treatment regimes. I am also eager to expand my research by incorporating more flexible statistical modeling approaches, including mixture modeling, machine learning and nonparametric or semiparametric statistical techniques.
